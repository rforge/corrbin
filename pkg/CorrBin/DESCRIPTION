Description: This package implements non-parametric analysis for clustered
 binary data. The elements of the cluster are
 assumed exchangeable, and identical joint distribution (also known as marginal compatibility,
 or reproducibility) is assumed for clusters of different sizes.
 A trend test based on stochastic ordering is implemented.
