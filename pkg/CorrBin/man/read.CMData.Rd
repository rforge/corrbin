\usage{
read.CMData(file, with.clustersize = TRUE, with.freq = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{name of file with data. The data in the file should be structured as described above.}

\item{with.clustersize}{logical indicator of whether a cluster size variable is present
in the file}

\item{with.freq}{logical indicator of whether a frequency variable is present
in the file}

\item{...}{additonal arguments passed to \code{\link[utils]{read.table}}}

\value{
a \code{CMData} object

\description{
A convenience function to read data from specially structured file directly
into a \code{CMData} object. There are two basic data format options:  etiher the counts of responses of all categories are given (and the
cluster size is the sum of these counts), or  the total cluster size is given with the counts of all but one category.
The first column should always give the treatment group, then either the counts for each category (first option, chosen by setting
\code{with.clustersize = FALSE}), or the size of the cluster followed by the counts for all but one category (second option,
chosen by setting \code{with.clustersize = TRUE}). Optionally, a last column could
give the number of times the given combination occurs in the data.
