\title{ Finding the NOSTASOT dose}
\description{
The NOSTASOT dose is the No-Statistical-Significance-Of-Trend dose -- the largest dose 
at which no trend in the rate of response has been observed. It is often used to determine
a safe dosage level for a potentially toxic compound.
}
\usage{
NOSTASOT(cbdata, test = c("RS", "GEE", "GEEtrend", "GEEall", "SO"), exact = test == "SO", R = 100, sig.level = 0.05, control = mixControl())
}
\arguments{
  \item{cbdata}{a \code{\link{CBData}} object}
  \item{test}{character string defining the desired test statistic. See \code{\link{trend.test}} for details.}
  \item{exact}{logical, should an exact permutation test be performed. See \code{\link{trend.test}} for details.}
  \item{R}{integer, number of permutations for the exact test}
  \item{sig.level}{numeric between 0 and 1, significance level of test}
  \item{control}{an optional list of control settings for the stochastic order ("SO") test, 
     usually a call to \code{\link{mixControl}}.  See there for the names of the settable control 
     values and their effect.}
}
\details{
  A series of hypotheses about the presence of an increasing trend overall, with all but the last group,
  all but the last two groups, etc.  are tested. Since this set of hypotheses forms a closed family, one can
  test these hypotheses in a step-down manner with the same \code{sig.level} type I error rate at each step and
  still control the family-wise error rate. 
  
  The NOSTASOT dose is the largest dose at which the trend is not statistically significant. If the trend test
  is not significant with all the groups included, the largest dose is the NOSTASOT dose. If the testing
  sequence goes down all the way to two groups, and a significant trend is still detected, the lowest dose
  is the NOSTASOT dose. This assumes that the lowest dose is a control group, and this convention might
  not be meaningful otherwise.  
    
}
\value{
 a list with two components
  \item{NOSTASOT }{character string identifying the NOSTASOT dose.}
  \item{p }{numeric vector of the p-values of the tests actually performed. The last element corresponds
        to all doses included, and will not be missing. p-values for tests that were not actually
        performed due to the procedure stopping are set to NA.}
