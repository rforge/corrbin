\description{
This is a classical developmental toxicology data set. Pregnant banded Dutch rabbits
were treated with one of four levels of a chemical. The actual doses are not known,
instead the groups are designated as Control, Low, Medium, and High. Before term the
animals were sacrificed, and the total number of fetuses, as well as the number affected
by the treatment was recorded.

\usage{data(shelltox)}
\format{
  A 'CBData' object, that is a data frame  with the following variables
  \tabular{ll}{
    Trt          \tab factor giving treatment group\cr
    ClusterSize  \tab the size of the litter\cr
    NResp        \tab the number of affected fetuses\cr
    Freq         \tab the number of litters with the given ClusterSize/NResp combination\cr
